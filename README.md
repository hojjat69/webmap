# webmap
In this repository, I provide  HTML and javascript source files written using JQUERY, leaflet to visualize seven important locations in my hometwon.
Each location has popup with image, description and associated buttom with functionality of zoom to the location.
Moreover, using turf API, a simple geospatial analysis of making buffer around 6 locations is added to the map. 


1. you need XAMPP cross-platform web server to visualize the website in full functionallity. So first download and install it. 
https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html


2. Inside the XAMPP directory, find htdocs and making a folder with name of webmap01. The you should clone all files and folders 
   then put all in the wemap01.
   
   
   
3. Then start XAMPP-control (it is inside the XAMPP folder) and start apache.


4. Open your browser and go to:

    `http://localhost/webmap01/`
